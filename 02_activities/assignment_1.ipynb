    "For this assignment, I chose to work with the web article **'What is Noise?'** by music critic Alex Ross. This piece examines the concept of noise in music and culture. Understanding the distinction between signal and noise is fundamental for AI professionals because it parallels the challenge of distinguishing useful information from irrelevant data in machine‑learning systems. By summarizing this article, we practice condensing nuanced content while reflecting on how notions of noise relate to data science, signal processing, and AI ethics."
